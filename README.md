# Matt Royer

Senior Software Engineer who’s been nerdy all his life.  
Computer nerd, movie nerd, LEGO builder, occasional Star Wars hat enthusiast.

I build **practical, product-driven software**, and I genuinely enjoy tinkering, prototyping, and experimenting. I like turning rough ideas into working systems, especially when it means automating away repetitive or annoying work (I’m lazy in the best way).

I know when to reach for existing tools and patterns, and when it’s worth building something custom to really understand a problem or make a workflow better.

### What I’m working on
I’m actively building out my portfolio with **fun, real-world projects** that let me:
- Prototype ideas quickly and iterate
- Automate workflows and reduce manual effort
- Learn new tools by actually shipping things

### What I build
- Web applications with a strong UX focus
- Internal tools and automation
- Feature work, experiments, and refactors
- Side projects that solve real problems (or at least my own)

### Tech I use
Ruby, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript  
Rails, Vue.js, React/Next.js (learning & building)  
APIs, background jobs, automation, frontend-leaning full stack work

That’s where I’m collecting and iterating on projects as I build them.

If you’re interested in how I think, prototype, and ship software, feel free to take a look or reach out.
